# Excel_Project-2
Build an interative dashboard using data of a coffee shop.
We started this project by making use of the functions "XLOOKUP" and "INDEX MATCH" to search for specific data. We then converted the range of the data into a table before making some PIVOT TABLES and PIVOT CHARTS. After that, we inserted a TIMELINE and some SLICERS before building our DASHBOARD at the end.
